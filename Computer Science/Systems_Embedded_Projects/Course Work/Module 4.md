# Module 4: Timers and Interrupts in Embedded Systems

---

### **Overview**

This module introduces timers and interrupts, essential for precise timing control, event handling, and power-efficient operation in embedded systems.

## **Part 1: Timers and Counters**

### **4.1 Understanding Timers and Their Uses**

#### **Objective:** Learn how timers work and their role in embedded systems.

**Key Concepts:**

- Difference between timers and counters
    
- Timer clock source and prescalers
    
- Applications: delays, event counting, PWM generation
    

#### **Assignment:**

- Configure a timer to generate a 1-second delay.
    
- Implement a counter to count button presses.

### **4.2 Generating Delays with Timers**

#### **Objective:** Implement precise delays using timers instead of blocking loops.

**Key Concepts:**

- Using timer overflow for delays
    
- Understanding delay calculation based on clock speed
    

#### **Assignment:**

- Create a function that generates a precise 500ms delay using timers.
    
- Measure the accuracy of the delay using an oscilloscope or logic analyzer.

## **Part 2: Interrupts**

### **4.3 Introduction to Interrupts**

#### **Objective:** Understand the role of interrupts in embedded systems.

**Key Concepts:**

- Polling vs. Interrupts
    
- Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)
    
- Nested and priority-based interrupts
    

#### **Assignment:**

- Write an ISR to toggle an LED when a button is pressed.
    
- Experiment with different interrupt priorities.

### **4.4 Timer Interrupts**

#### **Objective:** Learn how to use timers with interrupts for non-blocking tasks.

**Key Concepts:**

- Timer overflow interrupts
    
- Scheduling tasks using timer interrupts
    
- Periodic and one-shot timers
    

#### **Assignment:**

- Configure a timer interrupt to blink an LED every second.
    
- Use a timer interrupt to update a real-time clock (RTC) display.

## **Hands-on Project: PWM Signal Generation**

#### **Objective:** Generate Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals using timers.

**Project Requirements:**

- Configure a timer to generate a PWM signal.
    
- Adjust duty cycle to control LED brightness.
    
- Use PWM to control the speed of a DC motor.
    

#### **Expected Outcome:**

- A working PWM signal with variable duty cycles.
