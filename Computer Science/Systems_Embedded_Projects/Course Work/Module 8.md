## **Part 1: Memory Management in RTOS**

### **8.1 Dynamic vs. Static Memory Allocation**

#### **Objective:** Understand how memory is managed in an RTOS.

- Heap memory allocation vs. stack memory allocation
    
- FreeRTOS memory management schemes
    
- Best practices for efficient memory usage
    

#### **Assignment:**

- Compare dynamic and static memory allocation in FreeRTOS and write a summary.

### **8.2 Task Synchronization Techniques**

#### **Objective:** Learn how to synchronize multiple tasks in RTOS.

- Synchronization issues in multi-tasking
    
- Mutexes and deadlocks
    
- Using semaphores for task synchronization
    

#### **Assignment:**

- Implement a FreeRTOS program using mutexes to avoid resource conflicts between tasks.

## **Part 2: Real-Time Debugging and Performance Optimization**

### **8.3 Debugging in RTOS**

#### **Objective:** Learn debugging techniques specific to RTOS applications.

- Using FreeRTOS trace features
    
- Debugging with SEGGER SystemView and Tracealyzer
    
- Identifying and fixing priority inversion
    

#### **Assignment:**

- Set up SystemView to monitor task execution in FreeRTOS.

## **Hands-on Project: RTOS-Based Smart Home Controller**

### **Objective:** Implement an RTOS-based smart home system with task synchronization.

#### **Requirements:**

- Task 1: Monitor temperature and control an HVAC system.
    
- Task 2: Detect motion and trigger an alarm.
    
- Task 3: Log sensor data and transmit it over UART.
    

#### **Expected Outcome:**

- A functional smart home system with efficient task management.
