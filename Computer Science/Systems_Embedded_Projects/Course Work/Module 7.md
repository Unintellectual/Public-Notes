# Module 7: Introduction to RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems)

---

### **Overview**

This module introduces Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS), their role in embedded systems, and how to use an RTOS to manage tasks efficiently. You will learn about multitasking, task scheduling, inter-task communication, and real-world RTOS applications. Practical exercises will reinforce the theoretical concepts.

## **Part 1: RTOS Basics**

### **7.1 What is an RTOS?**

#### **Objective:** Understand the concept and necessity of RTOS.

- Definition of an RTOS
    
- Differences between a general-purpose OS and an RTOS
    
- Hard real-time vs. soft real-time systems
    
- RTOS use cases in embedded systems
    

#### **Assignment:**

- Research three real-world applications of RTOS and summarize how they use RTOS.

### **7.2 RTOS Architecture**

#### **Objective:** Learn the core components of an RTOS.

- Kernel and its functions
    
- Task scheduler
    
- Memory management in RTOS
    
- Interrupt handling in RTOS
    

#### **Assignment:**

- Explain the differences between preemptive and cooperative scheduling.

## **Part 2: Working with FreeRTOS**

### **7.3 Getting Started with FreeRTOS**

#### **Objective:** Set up and run your first FreeRTOS project.

- Installing FreeRTOS
    
- Understanding FreeRTOSConfig.h
    
- Creating a basic task in FreeRTOS
    
- Running multiple tasks
    

#### **Assignment:**

- Write a FreeRTOS program that creates two tasks blinking two LEDs at different rates.

### **7.4 Task Scheduling and Priorities**

#### **Objective:** Learn about scheduling policies and priority handling.

- Task states (running, ready, blocked, suspended)
    
- Time slicing and priority-based scheduling
    
- Round-robin scheduling
    
- Task starvation and priority inversion
    

#### **Assignment:**

- Modify the LED blinking task to include priority-based scheduling.
    

---

### **7.5 Inter-task Communication**

#### **Objective:** Learn how tasks communicate in an RTOS.

- Queues
    
- Mutexes
    
- Semaphores (binary vs. counting)
    
- Event groups
    

#### **Assignment:**

- Implement a FreeRTOS queue system where a producer task sends data to a consumer task.

## **Hands-on Project: RTOS-Based Sensor Data Logger**

### **Objective:** Implement an RTOS-based system that reads sensor data and logs it.

#### **Requirements:**

- Use FreeRTOS to manage multiple tasks.
    
- Task 1: Read data from a temperature sensor.
    
- Task 2: Store data in a buffer using a queue.
    
- Task 3: Send data over UART periodically.
    

#### **Expected Outcome:**

- A functional RTOS-based sensor data logging system with smooth multitasking.
